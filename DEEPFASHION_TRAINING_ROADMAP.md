# DeepFashion Lower-Body Training Roadmap for CatVTON-Flux

## 🎯 Objective
Enable CatVTON-Flux to perform high-quality virtual try-on for lower-body garments (pants, skirts, shorts) by training on the SaffalPoosh/deepFashion-with-masks dataset.

## 📊 Current Status Analysis

### ✅ Confirmed Limitations
- **Current Model**: xiaozaa/catvton-flux-alpha
- **Training Dataset**: VITON-HD (upper-body only)
- **Supported Garments**: Shirts, blouses, tops, dresses (upper portion)
- **Missing**: Pants, skirts, shorts, full-body dresses

### 🎯 Target Capabilities
After training completion:
- ✅ Upper-body garments (maintained)
- ✅ **NEW**: Pants, jeans, trousers
- ✅ **NEW**: Skirts, shorts  
- ✅ **NEW**: Full dresses
- ✅ Higher resolution (768x1024)

## 📋 Training Strategy

### Phase 1: Dataset Validation (1-2 hours)
```bash
python easy_train.py setup
```
**Deliverables:**
- Dataset statistics and analysis
- Sample image visualization
- Training readiness report
- Quality assessment

### Phase 2: Test Training (2-4 hours)
```bash  
python easy_train.py test
```
**Deliverables:**
- Proof-of-concept training validation
- Loss curve analysis
- Memory usage optimization
- Error detection and resolution

### Phase 3: Full Production Training (8-24 hours)
```bash
python easy_train.py full --epochs 10 --push-to-hub --hub-model-id username/catvton-flux-deepfashion
```
**Deliverables:**
- Complete lower-body capable model
- Training metrics and logs
- Model evaluation results
- HuggingFace Hub deployment

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
